## 🔮 **For Production**

To enable real NFC and Solana Mobile Adapter:

```bash
npm run build:preview
```

npm install @solana-mobile/wallet-adapter-mobile react-native-nfc-manager
```

3. **Replace Mock Services** with real implementations

## 🎯 **Current Status**

**Demo-Ready** ✅ - Full UI and flow testing
**Expo Go Compatible** ✅ - Runs without native modules  
**Production-Ready** ⚠️ - Needs real wallet/NFC for production
